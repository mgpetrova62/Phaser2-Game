# ðŸŽ® My first Phaser 2 Game

A small game I created while learning programming.  
Built with **JavaScript** and **Phaser 2**.

## ðŸš€ How to run
1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Open the project in VS Code.  
3. Start **Live Server** (or any local server).  
4. Play the game in your browser!

## ðŸ’¡ Future ideas
- Add more levels  
- Improve graphics
